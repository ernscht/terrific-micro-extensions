# Readme - Grunt Terrific Micro Exporter

This npm package is a easy-to-use export module for Terrific Micro based on Grunt.js

This tool exports your views and assets into a versioned zip file. 
It fetches the HTML of your views, your dynamic assets and configurable additional files. 
You can change the folder structure within the export. Images can be automatically optimized by imagemin. 
Every release will create a new version (patch, minor oder major) and commit/push it to the project repository. 
Versions will be bumped automatically.
